This program is created to help navigating around bart station to be easier.
It provides information about each bart station that's obtained from yelp API,
and nearby restaurant from each bart station that's obtained from zomato API.
The program also includes a filter bar on the menu list that will help to narrow
the bart list to the desired bart location.

In creation of this program, a lot of help is provided from stackoverflow,
slideout.js and various website.
